  Webshop Simplified Open Hours
=====================================

This module is an add-on to ``webshop_simple``.

It creates configuration entries for setting open business hours.

This module overrides the cart update endpoint in order to check if order is passed during working hours.

Configuring open hours is done on the company level where you can set:

- Timezone

- Opening hour

- Closing hour

Adding to cart is only available each day between this interval set.
